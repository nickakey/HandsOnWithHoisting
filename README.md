## Why?

When I was learning hoisting, I really just wanted to poke around at problems until I understood what was going on. 

The issue? No one had coallated a set of hoisting examples that covered all features and edge cases of this concept.

This repo is build to cover ALL edge cases and concepts so that a beginner can go from hosting noob to expert in just one set ofproblems. 

## Usage

Copy all the problems from main.js into your IDE with a good terminal **OR** a tool like [Javascript Replit](https://repl.it/site/languages/javascript)

Then, one problem at a time - make a prediction on **WHAT you think will be logged** by the function.

After you make a prediction, comment out the function call, and run the code!

_If your prediction was correct_ - great! Next problem.

**If your prediction was incorrect** - STOP, learn more about hoisting, and don't continue until you are able to explain _WHY_ the code does what does.
